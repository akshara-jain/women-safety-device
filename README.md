# women-safety-device🚨
An IoT-based women safety device that sends emergency alerts with location tracking and places a call to an emergency number for personal safety.

## 📌 Overview
This project is a women safety device designed to help in emergency situations. 
The device can send instant alerts along with the user's live location to predefined contacts.

## 🔧 Features
- Emergency alert button
- Live GPS location tracking
- GSM-based message sending
- Compact and portable design
- Fast response during danger situations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino / ESP32
- GPS Module
- GSM Module
- Embedded C / Arduino IDE
- IoT Concepts

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User presses the emergency button
2. Device captures live GPS coordinates
3. Alert message is sent and place a call to emergency contacts
4. Location can be tracked in real-time
